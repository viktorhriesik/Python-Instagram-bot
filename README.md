# Web-Scraping-Instagram
Web scraping Instagram bot

The goal of this project was to develop a python web scraping bot using the Selenium framework to extract data from Instagram and follow/unfollow users.
The main goals include creating a robust script that can do these things:
- Log in to instagram
- get data from selected account (followers, following...)
- Automatically follow or unfollow users from your profile
- Copy followers from another profile
